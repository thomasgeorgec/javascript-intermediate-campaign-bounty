Welcome to our **Student Grading System web app**! This tool is all about making your life easier when it comes to managing and keeping tabs on student records. Whether you're a teacher, professor, or administrator, we've got your back, simplifying the process of recording and accessing student data.

In our web app, we've used a bit of **object-oriented programming**. What that really means is we've created a **"Student" class** to handle individual students. It's like a template for each student, and it stores data like their name, ID, and score. This makes everything nice and tidy, so you don't have to worry about a mess of data.

Now, let's talk about those **switch statements**. They're like decision-makers that help us handle different things you might want to do, like adding, updating, or checking out student records. When you click buttons and enter details, these switches figure out if everything looks good. If something seems wrong, like you forgot to type a name or ID, we'll give you a heads-up with a friendly message to set things right.

And speaking of user-friendliness, we've got error handling covered. Thanks to our trusty **try-catch-finally statements**, we can deal with any hiccups that pop up along the way. If something goes wrong, we'll catch it and tell you what's up in a way that won't make you scratch your head. The "finally" part is there to make sure we clean up after ourselves, even if things go perfectly.

All these cool features make our Student Grading System web app super handy. Classes keep student data neat and tidy, switch statements steer the ship, and try-catch-finally statements ensure we handle any bumps in the road with a smile. Enjoy managing your student records effortlessly!
